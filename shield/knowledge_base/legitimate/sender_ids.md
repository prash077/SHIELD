## How Indian Bank SMS Sender IDs Work

All commercial SMS in India must be sent through TRAI-registered DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) platform with registered sender IDs. Bank transactional SMS uses 6-character alphanumeric sender IDs, sometimes prefixed with AD- (promotional) or TD-/TM- (transactional).

## How Scammers Fake Sender IDs

Typosquatting: Using IDs like SB1BNK (number 1 instead of letter I), HDECBK (E instead of F), ICICL (L instead of I).

Appending: Using IDs like SBIBNK1, HDFCALRT, ICICINFO which look official but are not registered bank IDs.

Personal numbers: Sending from regular 10-digit mobile numbers claiming to be from a bank.

## How to Verify

If you receive an SMS and the sender ID does not exactly match the ones listed above, treat it with caution. Contact your bank through their official app or website to verify any claims made in the message.

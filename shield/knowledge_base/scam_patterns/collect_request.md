# UPI Collect Request Fraud

## What is Collect Request Fraud?

In UPI, a "collect request" is when someone requests money FROM your account. Scammers send fraudulent collect requests disguised as refunds, cashbacks, or prize payouts. The victim approves the request thinking they are receiving money, but they are actually sending money.

## How the Scam Works

Step 1: Scammer contacts victim on OLX, Quikr, or other marketplace, or calls pretending to be from a bank or company.

Step 2: Scammer says "I'm sending you Rs X as refund/prize/payment."

Step 3: Instead of sending money, the scammer sends a COLLECT REQUEST for that amount.

Step 4: Victim sees a UPI notification and enters their PIN thinking they're receiving money.

Step 5: Money is debited from the victim's account because they approved a collect (pay) request.

## Key Fact

You NEVER need to enter your UPI PIN to RECEIVE money. If any transaction asks for your PIN, it means money is going OUT of your account, not coming in. This is the single most important thing every UPI user must know.

## Common Scenarios

### OLX/Marketplace Scam
Buyer contacts seller, agrees to pay full price, says "I'm sending the money now." Sends a collect request instead. Seller enters PIN thinking payment is coming in.

### Fake Refund
"Your refund of Rs 2,500 is ready. Accept the request and enter PIN to receive." The request is actually a collect (debit) request.

### Customer Care Scam
Fake customer care agent says "I'm sending you a verification amount of Rs 1." Sends a collect request for Rs 10,000.

### QR Code Variant
Scammer shares a QR code saying "scan this to receive money." The QR code is a payment QR that triggers a collect request.

## Red Flags

- Anyone asking you to enter UPI PIN to "receive" money
- Collect requests from unknown UPI IDs
- Being asked to "accept" a payment (receiving money doesn't need acceptance)
- QR codes sent over WhatsApp or SMS claiming to send you money
- Requests with notes like "refund", "cashback", "prize amount"

## Prevention

- Remember: receiving money via UPI NEVER requires entering your PIN
- Decline all collect requests from unknown sources
- Never scan QR codes sent by strangers to "receive" money
- If someone claims to be sending a refund, check your bank statement directly
- Report fraudulent collect requests in your UPI app

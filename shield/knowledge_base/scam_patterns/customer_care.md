# Fake Customer Care Scam Patterns

## What is a Fake Customer Care Scam?

Scammers create fake customer care numbers for banks, UPI apps, and companies, then promote them through Google Search ads, social media, or fake websites. When victims call these numbers seeking help, the scammers pose as support agents and extract banking details or install remote access apps.

## How the Scam Works

Step 1: Victim searches Google for "[Bank name] customer care number" or "[UPI app] helpline."

Step 2: Top results may include fake numbers promoted through Google Ads or SEO manipulation.

Step 3: Victim calls the fake number and reaches a scammer posing as a bank representative.

Step 4: The fake agent asks the victim to install a remote access app (AnyDesk, TeamViewer, QuickSupport) for "troubleshooting."

Step 5: Once remote access is granted, the scammer can see the victim's screen, intercept OTPs, and make unauthorized transactions.

Alternative Step 4: The fake agent asks for card details, CVV, UPI PIN, or OTP directly.

## Common Scenarios

### Google Search Trap
Victim searches "SBI customer care" and calls a promoted fake number instead of the real one (1800-425-3800).

### Social Media Complaints
Victim posts a complaint about their bank on Twitter/X. A fake account posing as official bank support DMs them asking for account details.

### Fake App Support
Victim searches for PhonePe or Paytm support, reaches a fake number. Scammer asks them to install screen-sharing app.

## Red Flags

- Customer care asking to install AnyDesk, TeamViewer, or any screen-sharing app
- Being asked to share OTP, UPI PIN, CVV, or card number over call
- Customer care numbers found via Google search results (not from official app/website)
- Support agent asking you to make a "test transaction"
- Agent unable to verify your account details (name, last 4 digits) — real agents can look this up

## Prevention

- Never install screen-sharing apps at anyone's request
- Banks will never ask for OTP, PIN, or CVV over phone
- If in doubt, hang up and visit your bank branch in person

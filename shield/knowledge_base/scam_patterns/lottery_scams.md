# Lottery and Prize Scam Patterns

## What is a Lottery Scam?

Lottery scams inform victims that they have "won" a large prize in a lottery, lucky draw, or contest they never entered. To claim the prize, the victim must pay "processing fees", "taxes", or "verification charges" upfront. No prize is ever delivered.

## Common Templates

### SMS
"Congratulations! Your mobile number has been selected as the lucky winner of Rs 25,00,000 in the Jio/Airtel lucky draw. To claim, contact: [number] or click: [link]"

### WhatsApp
"Dear user, your WhatsApp number has won Rs 50 lakhs in the WhatsApp International Lottery. Send your name, address, and bank details to claim."

### Email
"You have been randomly selected to receive $1,000,000 from the Google/Microsoft Annual Lottery. Pay the processing fee of Rs 15,000 to claim your prize."

### Call
"This is from KBC (Kaun Banega Crorepati). You have won Rs 25 lakhs. To receive the amount, please pay Rs 5,000 as tax/processing fee."

## Red Flags

- You "won" a contest you never entered
- Prize notification via SMS, WhatsApp, or email (real lotteries don't notify this way)
- Requirement to pay money upfront to receive a prize (legitimate prizes never require advance payment)
- Urgency to claim within a few hours or days
- Request for bank account details, Aadhaar, or PAN
- Prize amounts that are unrealistically large
- Poor grammar and spelling in the notification
- Use of famous brand names (Jio, Airtel, Google, KBC, WhatsApp) without authorization
- Phone numbers that are regular mobile numbers instead of official helplines

## Key Facts

- You cannot win a lottery you did not enter
- Legitimate prize winners are never asked to pay fees upfront
- KBC (Kaun Banega Crorepati) does not conduct lotteries via phone or SMS
- Jio, Airtel, and other telecom companies do not run cash prize lucky draws via SMS
- Google and WhatsApp do not have "international lotteries"

## Prevention

- Ignore all "you have won" messages from unknown sources
- Never pay money to claim a prize
- Do not share bank details, Aadhaar, or PAN with unknown callers
- Report lottery scam calls/SMS to 1930
- Block and report the sender

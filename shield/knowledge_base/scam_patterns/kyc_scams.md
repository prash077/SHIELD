# KYC Update Scam Patterns

## What is a KYC Scam?

KYC (Know Your Customer) scams exploit the fact that banks genuinely require periodic KYC updates. Scammers send fake KYC update notifications via SMS, WhatsApp, or calls, directing victims to fake websites or tricking them into sharing sensitive details like Aadhaar, PAN, UPI PIN, or OTP.

## Common Templates

### SMS with Link
"Dear [Bank] customer, your KYC has expired. Update within 24 hours to avoid account suspension. Click: [fake link]"

### WhatsApp Message
"[Bank] Important: Your account will be frozen due to incomplete KYC. Download this form and submit: [malicious APK link]"

### Phone Call
"Hello, this is [Bank] calling. Your KYC documents have expired. I will help you update them over the phone. Please share your Aadhaar number and OTP."

### App Download Scam
"To complete KYC, download our verification app: [link to malicious APK]." The app captures screen data, OTPs, and banking credentials.

## How Real KYC Works

- Banks send KYC reminders but NEVER include clickable links in SMS
- KYC updates are done in-branch with original documents or through the official banking app
- Bank staff never ask for UPI PIN, OTP, CVV, or full card numbers over phone
- Video KYC is offered by some banks but only through their official app, never via random video call links
- RBI mandates that banks give adequate notice (30+ days) for KYC updates, not "24 hours"

## Red Flags

- SMS or WhatsApp message with a link for KYC update
- Threat of account block within 24 hours
- Request to download an APK file or third-party app
- Phone call asking for Aadhaar, PAN, OTP, or UPI PIN
- KYC "update" via WhatsApp or Telegram
- Sender ID that doesn't match official bank codes
- Generic greeting instead of your name

## Scale

- KYC scams account for roughly 30% of all phishing SMS in India
- RBI has repeatedly warned that banks never send links for KYC via SMS
- Most victims are elderly users or first-time digital banking users

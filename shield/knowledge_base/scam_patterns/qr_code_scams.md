# QR Code Scam Patterns

## What is a QR Code Scam?

Scammers manipulate QR codes to trick victims into making payments instead of receiving them. Since QR codes encode payment information that isn't human-readable, victims cannot verify what a QR code will do before scanning it.

## Common Patterns

### "Scan to Receive Money"
Scammer tells victim "I'll send you money, just scan this QR code." The QR code is actually a payment request. When scanned, it pre-fills a payment to the scammer's account. If the victim enters their PIN, money is sent to the scammer.

### Tampered QR Codes at Shops
Scammer physically replaces a merchant's QR code sticker with their own. Customers paying the merchant unknowingly send money to the scammer.

### Fake Parking/Toll QR Codes
QR codes placed at parking lots, toll booths, or public charging stations that redirect to phishing sites or payment requests.

### QR Code in Phishing Email
"Scan this QR code to verify your bank account." The QR leads to a fake bank login page optimized for mobile.

## Key Fact

Scanning a QR code to RECEIVE money makes no sense in UPI. To receive money, you share YOUR QR code (or UPI ID) with the sender. If someone asks you to scan THEIR QR code to receive money, it is always a scam.

## Red Flags

- Anyone asking you to scan a QR code to "receive" money
- QR codes shared via WhatsApp, SMS, or email from unknown sources
- QR codes at public places that look recently placed or cover another QR
- Being asked to enter UPI PIN after scanning (this means you're paying, not receiving)
- QR code leading to a website instead of your UPI app

## Prevention

- Never scan QR codes from strangers to "receive" payments
- To receive money, share your own QR code or UPI ID
- At merchant locations, verify the QR code matches the merchant's name
- If your UPI app shows a "pay" screen after scanning, do NOT enter your PIN
- Report tampered QR codes to the merchant and local police

# Phishing SMS Scam Patterns

## What is a Phishing SMS?

A phishing SMS is a fraudulent text message that impersonates a bank, UPI platform, or government body to trick users into clicking malicious links or sharing sensitive information. These messages create urgency and direct victims to fake websites that steal login credentials, UPI PINs, or OTP codes.

## Common Templates

### Fake KYC Update
"Dear [Bank] customer, your account KYC is incomplete. Complete verification within 24 hours or your account will be blocked. Click: [malicious link]"

This is the most common UPI phishing pattern in India. Banks do require KYC but never send links via SMS for it. Real KYC is done in-branch or through the official banking app.

### Account Block Threat
"ALERT: Your [Bank] account has been temporarily suspended due to suspicious activity. Verify your identity immediately: [malicious link]"

Creates panic by suggesting the account is already compromised. The link leads to a fake bank login page that captures the user's credentials.

### Fake Refund or Cashback
"You have a pending refund of Rs 2,500 from [Bank]. Claim now before it expires: [malicious link]"

Exploits greed. The link asks the user to "enter UPI PIN to receive refund" — but entering a PIN can only send money, never receive it.

### Fake Delivery Payment
"Your package from Flipkart/Amazon requires payment of Rs 49 for customs. Pay here: [malicious link]"

Targets online shoppers. The small amount makes it seem plausible, but the link captures card or UPI details.

## Red Flags in Phishing SMS

- Contains a shortened URL (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)
- Bank name appears in a non-official domain
- Asks to "click immediately" or "verify within X hours"
- Mentions account block, suspension, or KYC expiry
- Comes from a non-standard sender ID
- Grammar and spelling errors
- Uses generic greeting ("Dear Customer") instead of your name
- Contains words like "urgent", "immediately", "last warning"

## How to Verify

- Never click links in SMS from unknown senders
- Open your banking app directly to check account status
- Call your bank's official customer care number (from the back of your debit card)
- Check the sender ID against official bank sender codes
- Forward suspicious SMS to your bank's fraud reporting number

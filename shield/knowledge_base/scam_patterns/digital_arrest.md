# Digital Arrest Scam Patterns

## What is a Digital Arrest Scam?

A digital arrest scam involves fraudsters impersonating law enforcement officers (CBI, police, customs, income tax, enforcement directorate) over phone or video calls. They accuse the victim of crimes like money laundering, drug trafficking, or tax evasion and demand immediate payment to "settle the case" or avoid arrest. This became the number one fraud category in India in 2025.

## How the Scam Works

Step 1: The victim receives a call claiming to be from police, CBI, customs, or a courier company.

Step 2: The caller informs the victim that a parcel in their name has been intercepted containing drugs, fake passports, or illegal items. Alternatively, they claim the victim's Aadhaar or PAN has been used in money laundering.

Step 3: The call is "transferred" to a fake CBI or police officer who shows a fake ID on video call.

Step 4: The victim is told an "arrest warrant" has been issued. They are put under "digital arrest" — told not to disconnect the call, not to contact anyone, and to stay visible on video.

Step 5: The victim is pressured to transfer money to "RBI safe accounts" or "court settlement accounts" to avoid arrest. Amounts range from lakhs to crores.

## Common Phrases Used

- "An arrest warrant has been issued in your name"
- "Your Aadhaar has been linked to money laundering"
- "A parcel in your name was intercepted with illegal items"
- "You are under digital arrest, do not disconnect"
- "Transfer money to this RBI safe account"
- "This is confidential, do not tell anyone"
- "You will be arrested within 2 hours if you don't comply"
- "I am calling from CBI/ED/Cyber Cell headquarters"

## Red Flags

- No law enforcement agency in India conducts "digital arrest" — this concept does not exist in Indian law
- Police and CBI never demand money over phone or video call
- Real arrest warrants are served in person by uniformed officers
- No legitimate authority asks you to transfer money to "safe accounts"
- Being told not to contact anyone is a classic isolation tactic
- Video calls showing fake IDs and uniforms are fabricated
- Threats of immediate arrest create panic to bypass rational thinking

## Scale of the Problem

- PM Modi specifically warned about digital arrest scams in Mann Ki Baat October 2024
- Senior citizens lost over Rs 2,000 crore through impersonation scams in 2024
- Amounts stolen per victim average Rs 5-50 lakhs, sometimes crores
- Scammers use AI voice cloning to sound more convincing

## What to Do

- Disconnect the call immediately — no real officer will object
- Call 1930 (National Cybercrime Helpline) to report
- Contact your local police station
- No government agency asks for money to "settle cases"
- Share the experience with family to prevent others from falling victim

# Investment and Crypto Fraud Patterns

## What is Investment Fraud?

Investment fraud involves scammers promising unrealistic returns on investments in stocks, cryptocurrency, forex, or other financial instruments. Victims are lured through social media ads, WhatsApp groups, or Telegram channels promising guaranteed daily returns of 5-20%.

## Common Patterns

### WhatsApp/Telegram Trading Group
Victim is added to a group with fake "successful traders" posting screenshots of massive profits. A "mentor" offers to guide investments. Initial small investments show returns (paid from new victims' money). When the victim invests a large amount, the group disappears.

### Fake Trading App
Victim downloads a trading app that shows artificial profits. When they try to withdraw, the app demands "tax payment" or "processing fee" first. No withdrawal ever succeeds.

### Crypto Investment
"Invest Rs 5,000 in Bitcoin through our platform and earn Rs 50,000 in 30 days." The platform is fake. Initial deposits may show fake "growth" to encourage larger investments.

### Task-Based Earning
"Complete simple tasks (like product reviews, video likes) and earn Rs 2,000-10,000 daily." After completing tasks, withdrawal requires a "deposit" that is never returned.

### IPO Allotment Scam
"Get guaranteed IPO allotment for upcoming [Company] IPO. Pay Rs X for priority access." No one can guarantee IPO allotment.

## Red Flags

- Guaranteed returns (no legitimate investment guarantees returns)
- Daily returns of 2%+ (annualized that would be 700%+, which is impossible)
- Pressure to invest more to "unlock" withdrawals
- Unknown or unregulated trading platforms
- Telegram or WhatsApp-only communication
- Screenshots of profits (easily fabricated)
- Requests to download unofficial trading apps (APK files)
- "Tax" or "fee" required before withdrawal
- Celebrity endorsements (usually fabricated or deepfaked)

## Scale

- Investment fraud losses in India crossed Rs 4,000 crore in 2024
- Younger users (18-35) are the primary targets
- Fake trading apps are the fastest-growing fraud vector
- SEBI has repeatedly warned against unregistered investment advisors

## Verification

- Check if the platform is SEBI-registered at sebi.gov.in
- No legitimate investment offers guaranteed returns
- Real brokers (Zerodha, Groww, Angel One) have apps on Play Store/App Store
- If returns sound too good to be true, they are

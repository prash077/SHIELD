# PIN, OTP, and CVV Request Patterns

## The Absolute Rule

If an unsolicited message, call, or notification asks you to share your UPI PIN, OTP, CVV, MPIN, or password — it is ALWAYS fraud. No exceptions. No legitimate bank, UPI platform, RBI, or government agency will ever ask for these credentials.

## Why This Rule is Absolute

UPI PIN: This is your transaction authorization code. It is only entered in your UPI app to authorize payments YOU initiate. No one needs your PIN to "send" you money, "verify" your account, or "process" a refund.

OTP: A One-Time Password is sent to YOUR phone for YOUR verification. If someone is asking you to share it with them, they are trying to authorize a transaction on their end using your credentials.

CVV: The 3-digit code on the back of your card is a security feature for card-not-present transactions. No bank representative needs this to "help" you.

MPIN: Mobile PIN for mobile banking authentication. Same rules as UPI PIN — never share it.

## Common Tricks to Extract Credentials

"Enter your PIN to receive a refund" — You NEVER need to enter a PIN to receive money.

"Share the OTP I just sent for verification" — The scammer initiated a transaction and needs YOUR OTP to complete it.

"I need your CVV to process the reversal" — No reversal or refund process requires your CVV.

"Download this app and enter your PIN for account verification" — The app captures your PIN.

"I'm from [Bank] IT department, we need your PIN to fix a technical issue" — Bank IT staff never contact customers for PIN.

## What Banks Actually Do

Banks may call you to confirm a suspicious transaction but they will NEVER ask for your PIN, OTP, or CVV. They will ask you to confirm the transaction details (amount, merchant) and ask you to answer your security questions. If in doubt, hang up and call the number on the back of your debit card.

## In Multiple Languages

English: "Never share your OTP, PIN, or CVV with anyone"
Hindi: "Apna OTP, PIN ya CVV kisi ke saath share na karein"
Telugu: "Mee OTP, PIN leda CVV evariki cheppakandi"

This message is printed on every ATM, banking app, and UPI platform in India for a reason.

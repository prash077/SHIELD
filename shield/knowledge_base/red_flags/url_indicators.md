# URL Red Flag Indicators

## How to Identify a Phishing URL

### URL Shorteners
Legitimate banks never use URL shorteners like bit.ly, tinyurl.com, goo.gl, t.co, rb.gy, or cutt.ly in official communications. Shortened URLs hide the real destination, making it impossible to verify where the link actually leads.

### Bank Name in Non-Official Domain
Scammers include bank names in fake domains to create false trust. Examples of fake domains: sbi-kyc-update.com, hdfc-secure-login.xyz, icici-verify.online. Official domains for major Indian banks are: sbi.co.in, onlinesbi.sbi, hdfcbank.com, icicibank.com, axisbank.com, kotak.com.

### Suspicious Top-Level Domains
Cheap domain extensions like .xyz, .top, .click, .buzz, .info, .online, .site, .fun, .club, .live, .work, and .loan are heavily used by scammers because they cost very little to register. No major Indian bank uses these extensions.

### IP Addresses Instead of Domains
URLs that use raw IP addresses (like http://192.168.1.1/login) instead of domain names are almost always malicious. All legitimate banking websites use proper domain names with valid SSL certificates.

### Missing HTTPS
All legitimate banking and financial websites use HTTPS (the padlock icon). A URL starting with http:// instead of https:// for a banking site is a red flag. However, note that some phishing sites do use HTTPS, so HTTPS alone does not guarantee safety.

### Misspelled Domains
Scammers register domains that look almost identical to real ones: sblbank.com (instead of sbibank.com), hdfcbnak.com (instead of hdfcbank.com), icicl-bank.com (instead of icicibank.com). This is called typosquatting.

### Excessive Subdomains
Scammers use subdomains to make URLs look legitimate: sbi.secure.verify.login.fakesite.xyz. The actual domain here is fakesite.xyz, but the subdomains make it appear to be from SBI.

### Suspicious Path Keywords
Phishing URLs often contain action words in the path: /verify, /update, /confirm, /secure, /login, /account, /kyc, /refund, /claim, /reward. Legitimate banking URLs are typically cleaner and shorter.

## Quick Rule
If you did not initiate the interaction (you didn't open your banking app or visit the bank website yourself), do not trust any URL in a message. Instead, open your banking app directly or type the bank's official website address manually in your browser.
